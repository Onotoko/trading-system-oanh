# Incident Response Playbook

## Purpose

This documentation provides a systematic approach to incident response, ensuring consistent and efficient handling of service disruptions. The goal is to minimize downtime, maintain clear communication, and facilitate continuous improvement through structured post-incident analysis.

## Organization

This playbook follows a hierarchical structure for quick reference during high-stress situations:

- **Incident Classification** - Severity levels and impact assessment
- **Response Architecture** - Team roles and communication flows  
- **Operations Procedures** - Step-by-step response actions
- **Infrastructure Integration** - Tool usage and escalation paths

---

## Incident Classification

### Severity Levels

Incidents are classified based on business impact and urgency:

**Critical**
- Complete service outage affecting all users
- Data loss or corruption
- Security breach with potential data exposure
- Response time: Immediate (0-5 minutes)

**High** 
- Major feature unavailable affecting >50% of users
- Significant performance degradation (>50% slower)
- Payment processing failures
- Response time: 15 minutes

**Medium**
- Minor feature issues affecting <50% of users
- Moderate performance impact
- Non-critical integrations failing
- Response time: 1 hour

**Low**
- Cosmetic issues with no functional impact
- Edge case failures
- Documentation or minor UX issues
- Response time: Next business day

### Impact Assessment Framework

When classifying incidents, consider:
- **User Impact**: Number of affected users and user types
- **Business Impact**: Revenue loss, reputation damage, compliance issues
- **System Impact**: Infrastructure stability, data integrity, security posture

## Operations Procedures

### Initial Response Protocol (0-15 minutes)

**Step 1: Detection and Acknowledgment (0-5 minutes)**

When discovering an incident:
1. **Verify the Issue**: Confirm through monitoring dashboards and user reports
2. **Acknowledge Alerts**: Mark alerts as acknowledged in monitoring systems
3. **Initial Notification**: Post to `#incidents` using the standard template

**Incident Notification Template:**
```
ðŸš¨ INCIDENT DETECTED
Severity: [Critical/High/Medium/Low]
Service: [affected service name]
Impact: [brief user-facing description]
Detection Time: [HH:MM UTC]
IC: [name or "assigning"]
Status: Investigating
Tracking: [incident-specific channel to be created]
```

**Step 2: Incident Command Establishment (5-10 minutes)**

1. **Assign Incident Commander**: Self-declaration or assignment by team lead
2. **Create Communication Channels**: 
   - Incident-specific Slack channel: `#incident-YYYY-MM-DD-brief-description`
   - War room video call for Critical/High incidents
3. **Initialize Documentation**: Copy incident tracking template and begin timeline

**Step 3: Team Mobilization (10-15 minutes)**

1. **Role Assignment**: IC assigns Lead Investigator and Communications Lead
2. **Subject Matter Experts**: Bring in specialists based on affected systems
3. **Stakeholder Notification**: Alert relevant managers and business stakeholders
4. **Resource Allocation**: Ensure team has necessary access and tools

### Investigation Methodology

**Systematic Investigation Approach**

**Phase 1: Information Gathering (15-25 minutes)**
- Review recent deployments and configuration changes (last 24-48 hours)
- Analyze monitoring dashboards, metrics, and log aggregation systems
- Check third-party service status pages and integration health
- Interview team members involved in recent changes
- Document all findings in incident tracking document

**Phase 2: Hypothesis Formation (25-40 minutes)**
- Develop working hypotheses based on symptoms and recent changes
- Prioritize hypotheses by likelihood and potential impact
- Assign investigation tasks if multiple team members are involved
- Establish testing approach for each hypothesis

**Phase 3: Testing and Validation (Ongoing)**
- Test hypotheses systematically, starting with most likely causes
- Document both positive and negative results
- Maintain regular communication with IC (every 15-30 minutes)
- Adjust investigation approach based on findings

**Phase 4: Resolution Implementation**
- Obtain IC approval before implementing any changes
- Prepare and test rollback procedures
- Implement fix with appropriate monitoring
- Verify resolution through multiple validation methods

### Common Incident Patterns and Response Procedures

**Database Performance Issues**
- **Immediate Actions**: Check connection pool utilization and active connection counts
- **Investigation**: Identify long-running queries and lock contention
- **Mitigation**: Consider query termination, connection pool adjustment, or read replica failover
- **Resolution**: Query optimization, index creation, or resource scaling

**API Service Degradation**
- **Immediate Actions**: Verify load balancer health and SSL certificate validity
- **Investigation**: Check rate limiting, authentication services, and downstream dependencies
- **Mitigation**: Implement circuit breakers, increase rate limits, or failover to backup services
- **Resolution**: Code fixes, capacity scaling, or third-party service resolution

**Frontend Application Issues**
- **Immediate Actions**: Check CDN status and cache invalidation
- **Investigation**: Verify build deployment, browser console errors, and asset delivery
- **Mitigation**: Cache purging, rollback to previous version, or CDN failover
- **Resolution**: Code fixes, build process correction, or CDN configuration updates
